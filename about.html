													<h3>Who am I?</h3>
											<p>
													I'm an Arizonan designer who has an interest in making various systems interact nicely with people. My experience with video games has influenced and informed my sense of design, as they have taught me to
													think about what may create an appealing, interactive experience, and what may not. It started with drawing the various characters from Pokemon, but my infautations later expanded
													to Minecraft, Fire Emblem, and League of Legends. To me, games are essentially a story with interactive elements, which is an integral way for the developers to connect with the target audience.
													Now, I find myself analyzing these visual aspects I come across in games, along with the more technical ones to figure out what leaves an impact, and what creates a good, enjoyable experience for the end user. 
													During my free time, I enjoy drawing, learning about Unity and Blender, or crafting Minecraft modpacks to play with my friends. 
											</p></section>
													<h3>Education & Experience</h3>
											<section> <p>
													I earned my bachelors degree in Graphic Information Technology from Arizona State University, where I learned
													about Animation, 3D modelling, and Design. I have worked with most of the Adobe Suite to make videos, animations, print materials, and artwork for various college projects.
													Additionally, I learned a lot about game development and the Unity engine while pursuing
													a game development certificate. I've worked with multiple groups of people during my classes, creating games, videos, and animations.
													My time at ASU also included employment as a teachers assistant and grader, where I helped my peers improve by providing assistance and feedback.
													Other than that, I've dabbled with doing art freelance for fun.

													<h3>What do I do?</h3>
													I would currently consider myself more of a generalist, as I am able to understand and work with 3D modelling, animation, texturing, design, illustration and print. I can work
													with many common design tools such as the Adobe Suite, and Figma, along with 3D modelling software like Autodesk Maya and Blender. Also, I have experience working within Unity
													and coding C# scripts for Unity games. I also made a few basic, experimental minecraft mods coded in Java.  My hope for the future is to find something to specialize in, and my current aspiration is to get more 
													into UI/UX research and design, because I am interested in how people interact with products.
