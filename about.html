													<h3>Hi, I'm Tyler!</h3>
											<p>
													I'm an Arizonan game developer who primarily works on the design aspects of games, though I am open to expanding past games! I've always
													been interested in the visual aspects of games. It started with drawing the various characters from Pokemon, but my infautations later expanded
													to Minecraft, Fire Emblem, and League of Legends. To me, games are essentially a story with interactive elements, which is an integral way for the developers to connect with the target audience.
													Now, I find myself analyzing these visual aspects I come across in games, along with the more technical ones to figure out
													what leaves an impact, and what creates a good, enjoyable experience for the end user. During my free time, I am usually trying to learn, because I believe that knowledge is power, and I want
													to get better at what I do. 
											</p></section>
													<h3>Education</h3>
											<section> <p>
													I earned my bachelors degree in Graphic Information Technology from Arizona State University, where I learned
													about Animation, 3D modelling, and Design. Additionally, I learned a lot about game development and the Unity engine while pursuing
													a game development certificate. I've worked with multiple groups of people during my classes, working on quick game jams and larger, more comprehensive indie games.
													My time at ASU also included employment as a teachers assistant and grader, where I helped my peers improve by providing assistance and feedback.
											</section></p>

													<h3>What do I do?</h3>
													I would currently consider myself more of a generalist, as I am able to understand and work with 3D modelling, animation, texturing, design, illustration and print. I can work
													with many common design tools such as the Adobe Suite, and Figma, along with 3D modelling software like Autodesk Maya and Blender. Also, I have experience working within Unity
													and coding C# scripts for Unity games. My hope for the future is to find something to specialize in, and my current aspiration is to get more into UI/UX research and design,
													because I am interested in how people interact with products.
